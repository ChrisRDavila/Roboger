## Description

This webpage is designed to gather take information input by the user and respond via loops and branching to specified data to retrieve a specialized message upon submission.  Users can input whatever data they want, the loops will gather the data, divide it into seperate elements of an array and return responces that switch change the input into a Mr rogers themed message if the elements correspond to a specified parameter.  The returned data will be returned parsed out into unordered lines and upon resetting the page can be actived from the same browser as many times as desired. Code review for OOP

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository to your desktop_
* _Navigate to top level of directory_
* _Open index.html in browser_
* _Enter desired data into input space and submit to recieve unordered list of elements with sustitutuions for 1, 2 and 3_
* _reload page and repeat as many times as needed_

## Known Bugs

* no response to characters that are not numbers
* if multiple seperate number entered only responds to first number
* if standard american or european seperators for thousand or million and on used (, or .) only identifies number(s) before the seperator (ie 1,002 would be 1)
* cannot identify any partial numbers or fractions, only responds to integers preceding seperation (ie 1.5 = 1 and 1/5 = 1)
