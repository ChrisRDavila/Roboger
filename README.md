Users can input whatever data they want, the loops will gather the data, divide it into seperate elements of an array and return responces that switch change the input into a Mr rogers themed message if the elements correspond to a specified parameter.  The returned data will be returned parsed out into unordered lines and upon resetting the page can be actived from the same browser as many times as desired.

* _reload page and repeat as many times as needed_
